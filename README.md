# INTRODUCTION 
This python file contains a set of different anomaly detection algorithms tested on Numenta Anomaly Benchmark dataset. The algorithms that i am using are **Isolation Forest**, **One Class SVM**, **Local outlier Factor** and **Elliptic Envelope**.

# About the Data
Numenta Anomaly Benchmark or NAB for short, contains a wide variety of timeseries datasets. The one I am using in this project is called **"machine_temperature_system_failure.csv"** and it is a univariate timeseries. It contains the temperature values of an industrial machine within a period of time.
